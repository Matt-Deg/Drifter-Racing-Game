# Drifter-Racing-Game
This repository holds pieces of a collaborative racing project I created along with three classmates for a Software Engineering Course. All files uploaded here were solely worked on by me for this project.

It includes:
A car controller C# script that defines the movement of the car.
A speedometer C# script that places and updates a speedometer on the screen for the player.
A racetrack sketchup file that is a model for one track in the game.
